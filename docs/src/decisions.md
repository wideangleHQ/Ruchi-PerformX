# Decision log

Newest at the bottom. An entry goes in the same commit as the change it
describes.

Write one whenever you pick between two reasonable options: schema shape, role
rules, notification or socket behaviour, a new dependency, a pattern other
modules will copy, or anything a future reader would otherwise have to reverse
engineer from a diff. Skip it for renames, typo fixes, and anything the diff
explains on its own.

The shape:

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD Short title

**Decision.** One sentence, present tense.
**Why.** The constraint that forced it.
**Instead of.** What was rejected, and what was wrong with it.
**Costs.** What this makes harder later, or "none known".
```

Nothing is deleted from this file. A decision that turns out wrong gets a new
entry that supersedes the old one by date and says so.

The Phase 1 decisions that predate this log are described in their chapters:
roles and department scoping in [Auth and roles](p1_auth_and_roles.md), the
three audit mechanisms and the missing migrations in
[Known gaps](p1_known_gaps.md).

## 2026-08-16 Decisions live in the handbook, not in a separate file

**Decision.** The decision log is a handbook chapter, so it builds, searches,
and gets read alongside everything else.
**Why.** A `DECISIONS.md` at the repository root would be a second place to keep
current, and the handbook is already the thing people are told to read first.
**Instead of.** A root file, which drifts, or one file per decision, which is
process for a repository with a single active developer.
**Costs.** Every entry needs `just docs-build` to pass, so a malformed entry
breaks the docs build rather than sitting there quietly.
